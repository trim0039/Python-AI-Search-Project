# Python-AI-Search-Project
I worked on this project during my time at the University of Minnesota. We utilized turtle graphics to represent the different searches.

To run simply download the code, open the project folder from a text editor with temrinal. Run the file using $python3 city_grid.py. Turtle graphics slows down the searched but provides a nice visual representaiton of explored and path taken with the use of gray (explored) and black (path taken) tiles. Purple tiles are out of bounds and obstacles, white tiles are unexpelored tiles.

The order of searches are displayed in the temrinal window as well as the timing differences between all the searches. This can be piped into a csv file and processed for data on the searches.
